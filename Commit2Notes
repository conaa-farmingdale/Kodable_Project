For the second commit, please review ONLY the DriverClass.java file.
I did away with the FXML file and have created the basic idea for the first scene only in JavaFX.
The character path is broken down into individual squares that do not have a stroke color set.
Therefore they blend together to create one path.
However if the character needs to stop and turn we can refer to the coordinate points that we need it to move in.
The character image is separate from the background images so it does have the ability to move anywhere on the screen.
It's going to be up to us when we set the ActionEvents for the arrow controls that the resulting position of the character is correct.
The arrow controls are set up in an HBox container.
